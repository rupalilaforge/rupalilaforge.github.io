Camp Firefly strives to create an engaging environment that meets the needs of each child. This preschool camp is designed to encourage a child's development: intellectually, physically, socially, and emotionally. The activities provided cover a variety of positive learning experiences, which include music, literature, language arts, social interaction and creative arts. A positive self-image and healthy relationships are a vital part of a child's development and our program strives to meet this goal.

Activities are organized around the individual interests of the children and capitalize on the special talents of the staff members. Within our centers, the staff works together to plan a program that is developmentally appropriate, encourages child-initiated activities and results in outcomes that spark new interests and promotes pride in accomplishments. 

We hope you enjoy what we have planned!  </h4><img src="canstock5791951.jpg" height="107"style="float:right" />
