<h3>A world class preschool and daycare</h3>
<h4>Dear Preschool Families,<br/><br/><img src="../../../../Downloads/download (6).jpg" width="169"  style="float:left" /></h4>  
<h4> With the year being half over, we are beginning to have the children 
do a little more for themselves here at daycare. At meals now, they are 
pouring their own drinks from a small pitcher. We are encouraging them to 
put their own chair away when they are done with it. We are helping them 
learn how to fold and put away their own napping mats too. These 
children are already great at putting on their coats by themselves and are 
learning the tricks of hats, gloves, mittens, zippers, snaps, and buttons. At 
this age they seem to enjoy taking responsibility for their things so we are 
encouraging them to be more independent whenever we can. </h4>
