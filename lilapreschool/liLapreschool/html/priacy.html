     Privacy Policy of LiLapreschool<br />
          
To Our Individual Clients:

<br />
Your privacy is important to us, and maintaining your trust and confidence is one of our highest priorities. We respect your right to keep your personal information confidential and understand your desire to avoid unwanted solicitations. A recent law change requires us (along with banks, brokerage houses, and other financial institutions) to disclose our Privacy Policy to you – which we are more than happy to do. We hope that by taking a few minutes to read it, you will have a better understanding of what we do with the information you provide us and how we keep it private and secure.
<br />
<br />
A. Types of Information We Collect
<br />
We collect certain personal information about you – but only when that information is provided by you or is obtained by us with your authorization. We use that information to prepare your personal income tax returns and may also provide various tax and financial planning services to you at your request.
<br />
<br />
Examples of sources from which we collect information include:
<br /><br />
interviews and phone calls with you,
<br />
letters or e-mails from you,
<br />
tax return or financial planning organizers, and
<br />
financial history questionnaires. 
<br />
