Technique for making chutny

A chutny is not a paste, so it is important not to over blend it. Overheating will also ruin your chutny, so use short pulses rather than blending for any length of time.

Keeping your Chutny safe

Chutny will keep indefinately in the freezer. But use small containers to avoid having to refreeze leftovers. Of course, power outages will greatly reduce the amount of time that your chutny can be kept—it is important that, once frozen, it is kept frozen until it is ready to be eaten.

Suggestion
Chutney is a sauce, a sweet or savory but usually spicy condiment. Originally from eastern India, chutny is made from a variety of fruits and/or vegetables, often containing significant amounts of fresh cilantro/ Dhaniya,fresh green or dried red chili peppers.

 I am sharing with you savory/ spicy chutneys And Dips! You can reduce the spicyness by reducing the amount of chillies. You can adjust all the ingredients according to your taste. All Indian savories are served with this Green Chutney or the Tamarind – Date Chutney. 

These types of chutney are best enjoyed with cheese, bread, salad  or cold meats, which also makes them amazing in a sandwich (and especially in a grilled cheese) but also perfect for a picnic lunch.  

I learned the chutney recipies from my mother, but the dips are my own creations.
